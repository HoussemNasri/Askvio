# Use RTK Query for Data Fetching and Caching

## Context and Problem Statement

In the context of managing data fetching and caching in our Redux-powered web application, we need to choose between two prominent solutions: RTK Query and Redux Saga.

## Decision Drivers

* **Simplicity:** The ease of implementation and simplicity of the chosen solution.
* **Ease of Integration:** How well the solution integrates with existing Redux and application architecture.
* **Performance:** The performance implications of the chosen solution for data fetching and caching.
* **Developer Experience:** The overall experience for developers in terms of usability and learning curve.

## Considered Options

* RTK Query
* Redux Saga

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **RTK Query**, because it provides a streamlined and integrated solution specifically designed for data fetching and caching within a Redux environment. While Redux Saga is a powerful and flexible middleware, RTK Query simplifies and standardizes the process, enhancing developer productivity and reducing boilerplate code.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### RTK Query

* Good, for its simplicity and reduced boilerplate code.
* Good, for seamless integration with Redux Toolkit and standardized patterns.
* Good, for optimized performance in data fetching and caching.
* Neutral, as developers may need time to adapt to the specific syntax.

### Redux Saga

* Good, for its flexibility and broad range of use cases.
* Neutral, for data fetching and caching as it requires more manual setup and customization.
* Neutral, for performance, as optimization depends on the developer's implementation.
* Bad, for potential increased complexity and boilerplate code.
