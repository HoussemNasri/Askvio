# Askvio
> *“Give and take is fair play” — English Proverb*

Askvio is an online knowledge platform created to help people find the answers they need. It's a place to discuss and get advice on any topic you want - from cooking and fitness to technology, cryptocurrency, and blockchain. Users share their experiences with others, answering questions for rewards in VIO tokens.
## Motivation
Research showed that in Q&A communities, *65%* of the answers are produced by just *5%* of the users. These numbers show a clear lack of participation for *95%* of users. To address this problem, we developed Askvio. With an innovative reward system and well-bla bla we aim to encourage all users to participate while keeping the content quality at an acceptable level.
